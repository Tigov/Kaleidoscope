# Kaleidoscope
This project was worked on with two other classmates and was written in assembler. Outputs a Kaleidoscope-looking page to the terminal with four fold symmetry. 
Only the source file is uploaded because I don't know how you will be running assembler on your machine. Included is a short video of an example output. At anytime, if you pause the video you will see that the colours are both vertically and horizontally symmetrical.
